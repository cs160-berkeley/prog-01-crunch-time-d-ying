# PROG 01: Crunch Time

This app allows you to enter a number of repetitions/minutes of a given 
exercise from a droplist and then converts that to the number of
calories burned. It will also display the equivalent number of
repetitions/minutes of other exercises from the same dropdownlist
required to burn the same amount of calories.
